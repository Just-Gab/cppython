# cppython
## Im building this whole project with chat gpt, if you dont like it im just trying to get used to promting and doing something fun, you can fork it and i will give credit to all contributors, i feel like making this project will help a lot of begginers to use python and stick with it
### here is the first response Define the language grammar: First, we need to define the grammar for our new Pythonic-C++ language. This grammar should be compatible with both C++ and Python syntax, with at least 85% similarity to Python. For this, we can use a parser generator like ANTLR or Bison.

### Create a lexer and parser: After defining the grammar, we'll create a lexer and parser for our new language. These components will be responsible for tokenizing the input code and creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) representation of the code.

###  Implement a code generator: The next step is to create a code generator that will traverse the AST and generate equivalent C++ code. The generated code should be semantically identical to the input code but written in C++.

### Create a runtime library: We might need to create a runtime library that helps bridge the gap between Python and C++ features. For example, we may need to implement Python's built-in functions or data structures in C++.

### Test and refine: Finally, we'll test the transpiler with various code samples to ensure it works as expected. We'll identify issues and refine the implementation as necessary.

### Here's a high-level overview of the transpiler's components:

### Pythonic-C++ language grammar definition
### Lexer and parser for the new language
### Code generator that produces C++ code
### Runtime library for bridging Python and C++ features
### Testing and refinement
### By following this plan, we can create a transpiler that converts code written in our new Pythonic-C++ language into standard C++ code.
